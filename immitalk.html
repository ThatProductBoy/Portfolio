        Immigrants, regardless of their documentation status, play a crucial role in America and deserve access 
        to essential services like healthcare, education, and legal support. However, fear of repercussions and a 
        lack of information often hinder them from seeking help. A Kaiser Family Foundation report highlighted that 
        69% of undocumented immigrants in California worry about detention or deportation due to insufficient information. 
        Our research further shows that many immigrants, including those hesitant to disclose their status, seek information 
        on critical matters like healthcare and employment but lack suitable platforms. This gap emphasizes the need for 
        discussion communities tailored for immigrants, providing a safe space to share concerns and access assistance. 
        Creating such a platform can empower immigrants to navigate challenges with confidence and support.

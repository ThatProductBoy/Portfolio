    <p>
        I’m currently a Product Manager at ImmiTalk, where I’m building 
        a resource center to help immigrants in the United States access 
        vital information and essential services for successful integration. 
        Before this, I was a UX Content Designer at PayPal, where I created 
        the PayPal Direct Deposit Tax Refund campaign that earned a 95% 
        customer approval rating.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Driven by empathy, I take the time to understand user problems and find 
        solutions to build products that are not only useful but also delightful, 
        through intuitive design and compelling storytelling that solve users' needs 
        and make a lasting impact on them.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not deep into problem-solving and building solutions, 
        I enjoy playing board games like Scrabble and Chess or working 
        on my movie scripts as a screenwriter.
    </p>
    <p>
        So if you’re looking for someone who is passionate about customer needs, 
        empathetic towards their challenges, and painstaking with product development, 
        my DM is open.

    Connect with me, and let’s explore how we can collaborate.

    <h3>A little about me</h3>
    <p>
        I’m currently a Product Manager at ImmiTalk, where I’m building a resource center to help immigrants in the United States 
        access vital information and essential services for successful integration. Before this, I was a UX Content Designer at PayPal, 
        where I created the PayPal Direct Deposit Tax Refund campaign that earned a 95% customer approval rating.</p>
        
        <p>Driven by empathy, I take the time to understand user problems and find solutions to build products that are not only useful but 
            also delightful, through intuitive design and compelling storytelling that solve users' needs and make a lasting impact on them.</p>
        
        <p> When I'm not deep into problem-solving and building solutions, I enjoy playing board games like Scrabble and Chess or working on 
            my movie scripts as a screenwriter.</p>
